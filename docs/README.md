# Feecc Cameraman

Feecc Cameraman is a microservice, designed to record video from several RTSP streams simultaneously on demand.

It provides a simple REST API interface to start and end recordings, get information about attached cameras (RTSP
streams). It also handles user authentication.

Feecc Cameraman comes as a part of the Feecc, a Web3 enabled production tracking system.

Cameraman is a microservice that is written in asynchronous Python using FastAPI framework and relies on [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to record video streams.

## Deployment

The app is supposed to be run in a Docker container and can be configured by setting several environment variables.

> Note, that we assume a Linux host in this guide, however you can also run Cameraman on any other OS, but be warned: timezone is defined by mounting host `/etc/timezone` and `/etc/localtime` files inside the container, which are not present on Windows machines, so you might end up with UTC time inside your container.

Start by cloning the git repository onto your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-cameraman.git
```

Enter the app directory and modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to your needs by changing the environment variables (discussed in the configuration part).

```
cd feecc-cameraman
vim docker-compose.yml
```

When you are done configuring your installation, build and start the container using docker-compose:
```
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

Verify your deployment by going to http://127.0.0.1:8081/docs in your browser. You should see the SwaggerUI API
specification page. Continue from there.

## Configuration

To configure your Cameraman deployment edit the environment variables, provided in `docker-compose.yml` file.

Environment variables:

- `MONGODB_URI` — your MongoDB connection URI ending with `/db-name`;
- `PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT` — leave null if you want testing credentials to work, otherwise set it to `true`;
- `FFMPEG_COMMAND` — ffmpeg command used for capturing the video stream;
- `CAMERAS_CONFIG` — a JSON-like string for camera configuration. This string represents a JSON list of strings, each one describing an RTSP stream (`-` separated stream number and RTSP stream URI). Example:
```
'["1-rtsp://login:password@192.168.88.239:554/Streaming/Channels/101"]'
```
